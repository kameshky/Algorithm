# Practice Python

Comeback refrence guide to my code and learning. Starting my python practice as a aim to clear an interview for core IT Company. Part of my daily plan.

## Getting Started

I am going to collect important information here about topics generally asked in interview. Also this is going to be my code collection as I understand them.
As big IT companies require good programming knowledge, this will be a guide.

###### Starting the journey

1. Adding a shebang line
  `#!/usr/bin/python3`
   Shebang line that defines where the interpreter is located generally on linux.

  `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
   This is used for portability over all Operating System.
