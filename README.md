# Practice Python

Comeback refrence guide to my code and learning. Starting my python practice as a aim to clear an interview for core IT Company. Part of my daily plan.

## Getting Started

I am going to collect important information here about topics generally asked in interview. Also this is going to be my code collection as I understand them.
As big IT companies require good programming knowledge, this will be a guide.

## Starting the journey

### General programming knowledge and know-to of Python 

1. Adding a shebang line:
- `#!/usr/bin/python3`:Shebang line that defines where the interpreter is located generally on linux.
- `#!/usr/bin/env python3`:This is used for portability over all Operating System.

2. if __name__ = "__main__" :< /br>Before executing the code Python iterpreter defines some variables, one of them is '__name__'. If script or program is run as a main program '__name__' is assigned a value "__main__". If imported from another module, that module's name will be assigned to '__name__'.<  /br>
By doing this main check we assure that following code will run only when script is run as main program.
